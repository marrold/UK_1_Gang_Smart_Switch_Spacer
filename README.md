This is a spacer plate for a UK single gang light switch, to allow you to mount a smart switch over the existing switch without modifications.

The switch must be a traditional flat profile switch rather than a modern "Low Profile" or curve fronted switch. Something like a Crabtree Capital SP 1 Gang Switch is perfect.

**N.B.** I measured a handful of switches and the rocker protrudes <= 5mm from the face plate. 5mm acrylic was enough for my switches, but 6mm might be a better choice if you can find it.
